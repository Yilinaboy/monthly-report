## Literature Search Strategies

After using full method of propensity score matching, we found that there are three valid predictors that could influence tenure promotion:

-   Journal type
-   Ethnicity
-   Year from Bachelor to PHD

Therefore, the search strategies are based on recent research papers which address the relationship between these three indicators and tenure promotion.

The key words that I used in literature search is the following:

-   "Interdisciplinary Research" AND "Tenure"
-   "Journal Rank" AND "academic promotion"
-   "Minority" OR "Ethnicity" AND "Tenure"

After reviewing the outcomes: I have identified the following as the key references:

-   Journal type [@knapke2022];[@yegros-yegros2015];[@m√§kinen2025];[@chen2015]

-   Ethnicity [@shaw2021]

-   BA to PH [@millar2013]
